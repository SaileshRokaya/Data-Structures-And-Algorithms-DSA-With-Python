Here are some basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions for practice:

### **Array & String:**
1. Find the largest and smallest element in an array.
2. Reverse an array without using extra space.
3. Find the second largest element in an array.
4. Check if an array is sorted.
5. Move all zeroes to the end of the array.
6. Find the missing number in an array of size `n` containing numbers from `1` to `n+1`.
7. Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.
8. Check if a string is a palindrome.
9. Reverse a string without using extra space.
10. Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

### **Searching & Sorting:**
11. Implement binary search in an array.
12. Find the first and last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.
13. Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
14. Find the Kth smallest/largest element in an array.
15. Find the majority element in an array (appears more than `n/2` times).

### **Hashing:**
16. Find if a pair with a given sum exists in an array.
17. Find the frequency of elements in an array.
18. Check if two strings are anagrams.
19. Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
20. Find subarrays with a given sum.

### **Linked List:**
21. Reverse a linked list.
22. Detect a cycle in a linked list.
23. Find the middle element of a linked list.
24. Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
25. Merge two sorted linked lists.

### **Stack & Queue:**
26. Implement a stack using an array or linked list.
27. Implement a queue using an array or linked list.
28. Implement a min stack (stack that supports `push`, `pop`, and `getMin` in O(1)).
29. Implement a queue using two stacks.
30. Implement a LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache.

### **Recursion & Backtracking:**
31. Find the factorial of a number using recursion.
32. Print all permutations of a string.
33. Solve the N-Queens problem.
34. Generate all subsets of a given set.
35. Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.

### **Tree & Graph:**
36. Implement a binary search tree (BST).
37. Find the height of a binary tree.
38. Perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversal.
39. Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a BST.
40. Implement BFS and DFS for a graph.
